The block diagram illustrated in FIG. 1 gives an overview of the proposed water level monitoring and control system, which consists of a PIC microcontroller as the heart of the system and the oscillator to generate the clock pulses needed to synchronize all the internal operations of the  PIC microcontroller, the power supply, to provide the necessary voltages for the proposed system, the water level sensor to measure the water level in a domestic tank, the water pump control unit to switch on or turn off the pump according to the water level. In the proposed system, the infrared sensor is used to measure the water level by measuring the distance between the water surface and the sensor and based on this distance, the amount of water inside the tank. can be determined.

The benefits of the proposed water level monitoring and control system can be surmised as follows: 

(i)	Saving power, this is because the amount of electricity used is limited due to the automatic controlling of water level. 
(ii)	Since the motor pump is turned off automatically when water is reaching the high level of the tank, there is no need to check the water level manually and as result of that the time is saving.   
(iii)	Water usage can be maximized with a water level control system. This is because the proposed monitoring system automatically provides more water during the middle of the day and less water at night based on the water level. As a result, water always remains at its appropriate level.

Water regulation is optimized using the water level control system, which means that wasted electricity and water is kept at a minimum and as result of this a substantial amount of money over time is saved.
